<h1>Why Exedra v1?</h1>
<p>It was nearly 2 years ago, we've got 1 month to develop the against the first phase. We have several candidates upon what framework we could use. Our developer, made an experimental framework called exedra. Unfortunately, the documentation was buried somewhere within the projects. Despite lacking a lot of components, this project managed to survive till this date.</p>
