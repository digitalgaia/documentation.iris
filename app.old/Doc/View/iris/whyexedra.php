<h1>Why Exedra?</h1>
<p>It was nearly 2 years ago, we've got 1 month to develop the against the first phase. We have several candidates upon what framework we could use but little time to test whether they could fit into this project. Our developer, made an experimental framework called <u>exedra</u>. Unfortunately, the documentation was buried somewhere within the project. Despite lacking a lot of components, this project managed to survive till this date.</p>
<h2>What's the different with Exedra v2?</h2>
<p>Everything is different. Most components are static in exedra v1, except certains. While exedra v2 is using much SOLID approach, focusing on route oriented design, and being flexible and light at the same time.</p>
<h2>Will this still be maintained?</h2>
<p>Yes, but expect no newer feature or much optimization.</p>
